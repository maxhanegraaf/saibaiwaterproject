  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Saibai Island relies on chlorinated lagoon water and household rainwater tanks for drinking water.
    However, multiple water sources introduce opportunities for contamination, leading many households
    to boil water as an added safety measure. Boiling water and reverse osmosis systems place significant
    strain on the island’s diesel-powered energy grid and increase environmental impacts.
  </p>
  <p>
    A low-energy, culturally appropriate, and place-based water treatment solution is required to
    provide consistently safe drinking water while respecting Saibai Island’s environmental,
    cultural, and geographical constraints.
  </p>

<section id="stakeholders">
  <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Community:</strong> Saibai Island households, including children and vulnerable groups.</li>
    <li><strong>Local & Regional Governance:</strong> Torres Strait Island Regional Council (TSIRC) and TSRA.</li>
    <li><strong>State Government:</strong> Queensland drinking water regulators.</li>
    <li><strong>Health:</strong> Saibai Primary Health Care Centre and Queensland Health.</li>
    <li><strong>Project Partner:</strong> Engineers Without Borders Australia (EWB).</li>
  </ul>

<section id="scope">
  <h2>Design Scope</h2>
  <h3>Assumptions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Regional council supports and leads implementation.</li>
    <li>Transportation to Saibai Island is complex and expensive.</li>
    <li>Residents have limited technical expertise.</li>
    <li>All households have a water source to be treated.</li>
    <li>Implementation costs are covered by EWB.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>In Scope</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use of locally sourced materials.</li>
    <li>Compliance with Australian Drinking Water Guidelines.</li>
    <li>Simple operation and maintenance.</li>
    <li>Culturally appropriate, community-aligned design.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Detailed structural or electrical system design.</li>
    <li>Construction of the system.</li>
    <li>Upgrading island-wide infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="functions">
  <h2>Functions and Subfunctions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Main Functions:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Meet regulatory drinking water guidelines.</li>
        <li>Sustain long-term operation.</li>
        <li>Accommodate community, culture, and environment.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Subfunctions:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Eliminate pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa).</li>
        <li>Prevent contamination and recontamination.</li>
        <li>Preserve water quality (clear, odourless, acceptable taste).</li>
        <li>Simplify maintenance and reduce lifecycle costs.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="constraints">
  <h2>Key Constraints</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Minimise ecosystem disruption and runoff.</li>
    <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Highly energy-efficient with minimal reliance on diesel generators.</li>
    <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Durable materials suitable for remote transport.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Low frequency, low cost, locally manageable.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural:</strong> Respect traditional relationships with water and land.</li>
    <li><strong>Regulatory:</strong> Compliance with all relevant standards.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="sustainability">
  <h2>Economic & Environmental Sustainability</h2>
  <p>
    The proposed water treatment system has an estimated construction cost of approximately $100–$200.
    It operates without electricity or fuel, resulting in near-zero running costs. Filter media require
    only occasional cleaning or replacement, which can be completed by community members without
    specialist tools or training.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compared to boiling water, which consumes significant energy per litre, the system becomes
    more cost-effective after several thousand litres of use, providing long-term financial and
    environmental benefits while protecting Saibai Island’s sensitive ecosystems.
